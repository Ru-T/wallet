#Description

This program contains one database table called Exchange. The table contains a recipient column, which identifies who received the money or who paid the money to the owner of the account; and an amount column which tracks financial transactions.

##Objective

In this program, the user can view a dashboard of high-level summary information about the transactions in the Exchange table. This information includes:

* Total amount in the account
* Total number of exchanges
* Total number of exchanges in the current calendar month
* The largest expense ever paid

##Negative Balance

If the total amount dips below zero, the program will warn you.
